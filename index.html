            From 2000 to 2010, the 1st decade of this century, everybody talked about â€˜Skillsâ€™ which students in schools should learn.  
The 4 Câ€™s of 21st Century Skills: Critical Thinking, Creativity, Collaboration and Communication. 
<br><br>In the 2nd decade of this century, 2011 to 2020, many of the acorns were born and  joined the school, skills turned into approaches to learning.  
<br><br> And now, we entered into the 3rd decade of this century, 2021 to 2030.
Silver Oaks is  constantly exploring ways to prepare our acorns for a  dynamic present and progressive future. Because they are true blue 21st century learners !  
At the dawn of this new decade, 2021- 2030, our acorns embarked on Mission 21st and made Project Graduation a grand success. 
<h6>Project Graduation ! Voice, Choice and Ownership of our acornsâ€™ graduation tests.</h6>
<h5>What did they do?</h5>
<h1>
<ul>
<li>Our creative acorns created a website of their choice. Designed it, suiting their thoughts. </li>
<li>Took the ownership, used their English language skills and posted their knowledge on each  page/section of their websites. Few, self-recorded their videos, pictures of their own talks to support their text.</li>
<li>The websites revealed the depths of their knowledge and the conceptual lens used by them.</li>
<li>They used all their skills and incredibly voiced their knowledge.</li>
</ul>
</h1>
    ðŸ’—  Our warm gratitude for the enormous responsibility and challenges that online learning placed on parents, guardians, teachers and students. We truly appreciate the way you created your time, space, routine, and support for your wardâ€™s learning at home. We are so thankful for all the amazing gestures of kindness and the wonderful feedback. Thank you dear parents for your valuable time and constant support.
